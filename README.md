# BruteForceEducational
Brute Force is cool so that I decided to make this for educational purposes and show how to make a simple one that currently works for gmail although the chromedriver is still a problem I'm having.
# itertools
This is the thing that allows you to bring the special characters in like * ! etc.
# chromedriver
This was very finicky and you need to make sure you download Seleium and make sure you are at the right interpeter because if not then the module could not be read and that sucked when coding so just giving you a heads up
# basic rundown
The programs works in this general flow:
1st asks you if you already have a list that contains the passwords that you want to use if you do have a list and say yes then it skips the next step however if you say no then it will create the list for your consumption that takes a very long time to make (~1 hour to use)
2nd It will then open chromedriver and go to the outlook and will use the outlook you provdied in the code to access
3rd It will use the email and type it in and go to the next button
4th It will type each password line by line (~2 hours) to test everything and then stops if it gets the correct password
5th it will then touch the button to go to next to enter
6th It will then tell you the correct password and lets you go inside the program
# Things you need to change in the code
Currently the chrome driver will work and will direct you to outlook. You need to provide some things like change the email adress and if you wish to do something like gmail then you must change some of the buttons and other stuff.
# Get out of jail free card
Don't use this for hacking because 1 it won't work as good as a professional one and 2nd that's illegal and this is only for educational purposes and passing an assignment.
# memory issues
This takes a lot of Ram to create the passwords and may brick older computers. Use this out of your free will.
# other notes
Just run the main file and make sure to have the empty word file with it.
# Gmail
Gmail can sniff out whatever or not you use a chrome driver so it won't work it unfournatley although the list generator will still work regardless so do with that as you will.
# Visual Studio Code
Best option in my opinion since you can just download the modules. This is what I use for this program
# Replit
Don't use this, it can't handle the data
# Beeg Beeg Yoshi!
