# BruteForceEducational
Brute Force is cool so that I decided to make this for educational purposes and show how to make a simple one that currently works for gmail although the chromedriver is still a problem I'm having.
# itertools
This is the thing that allows you to bring the special characters in
# basic rundown
The programs works in this general flow:
1st asks you if you already have a list that contains the passwords that you want to use if you do have a list and say yes then it skips the next step however if you say no then it will create the list for your consumption that takes a very long time to make (~1 hour to use)
2nd It will then open chromedriver and go to the gmail where with the specified gmail it was given will then go to the site type the things 
3rd type each password line by line (~2 hours) to test everything and then stops if it gets the correct password
4th will then tell you the correct password and lets you go inside the program
# Things you need to change in the code
Currently the chrome driver doesn't work however you may attempt to use it by downloading the chrome driver and then including the path in the code because currently it's just empty
You need to change the gmail to the person that you want to get into 
You need to clear the list before saying no to the question of if you have a list because it will just add more and more stuff
# Get out of jail free card
Don't use this for hacking because 1 it won't work as good as a professional one and 2nd that's illegal and this is only for educational purposes and passing an assignment.
# memory issues
This takes a lot of Ram to create the passwords and may brick older computers. Use this out of your free real
# other notes
Just run the main file and make sure to have the empty word file with it.
